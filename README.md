# COMSOL_tutorial
## Introduction:

**COMSOL Multiphysics** is a cross-platform [finite element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element) analysis, solver and [multiphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiphysics) [simulation software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_software). It allows conventional physics-based user interfaces and coupled systems of [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) (PDEs). COMSOL provides an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) and unified workflow for electrical, mechanical, fluid, acoustics, and chemical applications.
